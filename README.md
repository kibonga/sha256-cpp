# SHA-256 C++ Implementation

Welcome to the **SHA-256 C++ Implementation** repository! This project provides a clear and concise implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function in C++. The SHA-256 algorithm is widely used for data integrity verification, password hashing, and digital signatures.

## Features

- **SHA-256 Algorithm**: This repository demonstrates a C++ implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, making it easy for developers to understand and use.

- **Clear Code**: The code is well-commented and structured, making it accessible for learning and integration into other projects.

## Getting Started

To use this SHA-256 implementation in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kibonga/sha256-cpp.git
   ```

2. Include the necessary header files and source files (`SHA256.h` and `SHA256.cpp`) in your C++ project.

3. Use the `SHA256::hash` function to generate SHA-256 hashes for your data.

```cpp
#include "SHA256.h"

int main() {
    std::string data = "Hello, SHA-256!";
    std::string hash = SHA256::sha256(data);

    std::cout << "SHA-256 Hash: " << hash << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
